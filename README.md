# Auto Clock Speed (acs) ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/jakeroggenbuck/auto-clock-speed/Rust?style=for-the-badge)
A utility to check stats about your CPU, and auto regulate clock speeds to help with either performance or battery life.

## Goals
- First and foremost, this is a project to learn about Rust and Linux
- Secondly, try to improve upon AdnanHodzic's already amazing [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq)
    - Add options to display raw output of governors, clockspeed, turbo, battery, etc. for use in scripts or display panels like polybar.

## Install Latest Release
If you have cargo on your machine, skip to step 3

1. Install [`rustup.rs`](https://rustup.rs/).

2. Setup rust
   ```sh
   rustup override set stable
   rustup update stable
   ```

3. Install from crates
   ```
   cargo install autoclockspeed
   ```

## Install from github
Do steps 1 and 2 from other install if you don't have rust installed, then do this next step.

3. Clone the project and install

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed
   ```
   ```
   cargo install --path auto-clock-speed
   ```

## Systemd
In order to have auto-clock-speed start when you restart your computer you must follow these instruction
```sh
# IMPORTANT: Modify the service file to include
# the path to the binary file 
# (usually /home/username/.cargo/bin/acs)
```

```sh
# In the auto clock speed directory run this command to
# move the service file into your systemd directory
sudo cp acs.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

```sh
# Start and enable the service
sudo systemctl start acs
sudo systemctl enable acs

# Check service is up and running
systemctl status acs
```

# Usage
## Monitor
```sh
# Show the min, max, and current cpu frequency
# along with the cpu governor
acs monitor

# A delay (in milliseconds) can be set for both monitor and run
acs monitor --delay 1000
```

<br>

## Run
```sh
# Run requires sudo because it edits the cpu's frequency

# Edit speeds and shows exactly what monitor does
sudo acs run

# Shows no output but still edits speeds
sudo acs run --quiet
```
