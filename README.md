# Auto Clock Speed (acs) ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/jakeroggenbuck/auto-clock-speed/Rust?style=for-the-badge)

A utility to check stats about your CPU, and auto regulate clock speeds to help with either performance or battery life.
This proram is designed for Linux and Intel laptops, although it should theoretically work on AMD systems and sometimes desktops as well.
If you encounter any issues or bugs, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed/wiki) to see if there is a solution

## Goals
- First and foremost, this is a project to learn about Rust and Linux
- Secondly, try to improve upon AdnanHodzic's already amazing [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq)
- Add options to display raw output of governors, clockspeed, turbo, battery, etc. for use in scripts or display panels like polybar.

## Install Latest Release
If you have cargo on your machine, skip to step 3

1. Go to [`rustup.rs`](https://rustup.rs/) to install rust.

2. Setup rust
   ```sh
   rustup override set stable
   rustup update stable
   ```
   
3. Clone the project and install
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed

   cargo install --path auto-clock-speed

   # This is needed to have the root version of acs match the local installed version
   sudo cp ~/.cargo/bin/acs /usr/bin/acs
   ```
<hr>

Note: The latest release of acs can also be installed locally with the following
```sh
cargo install autoclockspeed
```

## In Action

## Systemd
In order to have auto-clock-speed start when you restart your computer you must follow these instructions
```sh
# IMPORTANT: Modify the service file (acs.service) in the
# project directory to include the path to the binary file 
# (usually /home/username/.cargo/bin/acs)
```

```sh
# In the auto clock speed directory run this command to
# move the service file into your systemd directory
sudo cp acs.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

```sh
# Start and enable the service
sudo systemctl start acs
sudo systemctl enable acs

# Check service is up and running
systemctl status acs
```
## Systemctl command
The line after `[Service]` in `acs.service` is the command that will be run. You may want to add or remove arguments, mainly `--quiet`.
```
[Unit]
Description=Manages Clock Speed

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/your-user-here/.cargo/bin/acs run --no-animation --quiet

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

# Config
### Using default config
```sh
WARN: Using default config. Create file /etc/acs/acs.toml for custom config.
```
This warning recommends creating a config file, use the following example and install at `/etc/acs/acs.toml`

```sh
mkdir /etc/acs
cp ./acs.toml /etc/acs/acs.toml
```

### This is an example config
also the default settings if no config is provided

```yaml
# acs.toml
powersave_under = 20
overheat_threshold = 80
```

## Turn Off
If you would like to turn off auto-clock-speed, here are the steps.<br>
Note: This should be done during testing of acs run mode.
```sh
# Temporarily stop (only lasts until reboot)
sudo systemctl stop acs

# Permanently stop until turned on
sudo systemctl disable acs
```

## Uninstall
Here is how to uninstall the binary and the systemctl service.
```sh
# Remove local binary
cargo uninstall acs

# Remove system shared binary
rm /usr/bin/acs

# Remove systemctl entry
rm /etc/systemd/system/acs.service
```

## Example Usage
Here are some examles of how acs can be used.
```sh
# Monitor mode
acs monitor

# Run as root
sudo acs run

# Get all speeds
acs get speeds

# Select gov from dmenu
sudo acs set gov $(acs get available-govs --raw | dmenu)
```

## Detailed usage
Detailed usage can be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/auto-clock-speed/wiki/Detailed-Usage)
